The Urbit Foundation offers cohort classes to teach you to produce and
distribute your own Urbit apps. App Academy teaches you how to build a Gall agent and connect it to a front-end. The course features hands-on, interactive learning, and teaches principles of good software design in Urbit. It is suitable for anyone that has completed [Hoon Academy](/courses/urbit-academy/ha) or equivalent material.

If you prefer to learn as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App Academy
is a good fit for you.

By completing App Academy as a cohort student, you should be able to design, implement, and distribute basic user apps and start contributing to Urbit userspace bounties.

The next cohort for App Academy will begin in summer of 2024. Until then, feel free to work through our online [App School
docs](/courses/app-school).
